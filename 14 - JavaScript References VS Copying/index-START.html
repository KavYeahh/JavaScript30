    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const copy = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    copy[3] = 'kavya';
    console.log(players, copy);
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    let copy1 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let copy2 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let copy3 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    let copy4 = Array.from(players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const obj1 = person;
    obj1.age = 15;
    console.log(person); // this will change main object 
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const obj2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const obj3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social : {
          twitter: '@wes',
          facebook: 'wesb'
      }
    };
    const dev = Object.assign({},person1);
    dev.social.facebook = 'kavya';
    console.log(person1); 
    // alternative 

    const dev1 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person1));
